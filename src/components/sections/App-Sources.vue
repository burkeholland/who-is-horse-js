              At this point we felt like all signs were pointing
              <b>strongly</b> to one person. But we still didn't have anything that we felt really sealed the deal.</p>
              <p>
                And then we found the smoking gun.
              </p>
            <p>Twitter always records the source of a tweet. Whether its web, iOS, Android or a third party app. If we take a look at all of @horse_js's tweets, they always originate from one of two sources.</p>

            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>
              @horse_js
              <b>uses Android</b>. This is a particularly damning piece of evidence because of all our suspects, only one uses Android and it's the same one we've been suspecting thus far.
            </p>
            <p>This also tells us that @horse_js is likely just one person. If it was multiple people, we would expect to see a different source (like iPhone) in there somewhere.</p>
