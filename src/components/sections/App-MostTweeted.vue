            <p>If we look at who @horse_js quotes most often, maybe we can examine common followers of all of these accounts and that would leave us with a pool of possible suspects. Here is a chart of all the people that @horse_js quoted more than 5 times in the past two years.</p>

              When we compared the common followers of all of these accounts,
              <b>all we found were a few spam bots.</b> Sometimes you chase down a dead end.
            </p>
            <p>But what else does this chart tell us? There are some people that @horse_js likes to quote frequently. After that it drops fairly consistently.</p>
