          <h1>A Major Assumption</h1>
          <p>Seeing all of the most tweeted people, it became clear that @horse_js is operating in a circle of friends. At this point, we made a single major assumption about @horse_js that holds up our entire ultimate conclusion:</p>
          <h2>@horse_js quotes themselves</h2>.
          <p>
            We did not feel like @horse_js would be able to show enough restraint to
            <b>not</b> quote themselves. The temptation is just too great and @horse_js is, only human, after all.
          </p>
          <p>Furthermore, this behavioral pattern would fit into a group of friends sharing an inside joke online.</p>
